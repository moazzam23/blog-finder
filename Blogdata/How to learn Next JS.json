Created by Facebook, React contains a collection of reusable JavaScript code snippets used for user interface (UI) building called components. It’s important to note that ReactJS is not a JavaScript framework. That’s because it’s only responsible for rendering the components of an application’s view layer. React is an alternative to frameworks like Angular and Vue, which all allow to create complex functions. This article will explore React’s features, explain how it works, and go over its benefits for front-end developers. We’ll also cover the differences between ReactJS and React Native regarding their roles in the web and mobile app development industry. Download Glossary For Web Beginners Lastly, we’ll discuss the steps to deploy a React application on Hostinger’s hPanel. React Features Why Use React? How Does React Work? What About React Native? How to Deploy a React Application on Hostinger React Features React has some core features that make it stand out from other JavaScript libraries. The following sections will introduce you to these features and explain how they contribute to mobile and web application development. JSX JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension used in React element creation. Developers employ it to embed HTML code in JavaScript objects. As JSX accepts valid JavaScript expressions and function embedding, it can simplify complex code structures. Let’s take a look at a code block that shows how to embed an expression in JSX: const name = 'John Smith; const element = h1>Hello, {name}/h1>; ReactDOM.render( element, document.getElementById('root') ); In the second line, we call the name variable inside a React element by putting it inside the curly brackets. Meanwhile, the ReactDOM.render() function renders the React element on the Document Object Model (DOM) tree, describing the UI. JSX also helps combat Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By default, React DOM converts values embedded in JSX to strings before rendering them. Consequently, third parties cannot inject extra code through user input unless it is explicitly written in the application.",
